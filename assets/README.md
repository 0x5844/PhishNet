## Overview

This directory represents a collection, each artwork is a visual representation of what **PhishNet** stands for. These pieces are not just for show; they are carefully designed to reflect the core ideas and goals of our project. As you explore the **PhishNet** documentation and interfaces, these images serve as a quick visual guide to our concept. The images here, referred to as *"PhishNet Art"*, are the result of generative art created by [*DALL.E-3*](https://openai.com/dall-e-3).

## Artwork Description

Each piece visually translate this project's principles, to make the documentation more accessible and engaging. Think of these images as a prelude to our research docs, offering an easy-to-grasp visual introduction before diving into the detailed concepts

### Style and Inspiration

The artwork is inspired by retro computer software aesthetics, specifically reminiscent of the classic Windows 98 graphics. The design is intentionally pixelated, providing a vintage look that evokes a sense of 1990s tech nostalgia.

### Theme and Symbolism

Central to each image is a fish figure, creatively used to symbolize the concept of 'phishing' in the realm of cybersecurity. The fish figure is not just a literal representation of the term 'phishing' but also serves as a playful yet relevant element that ties back to the core theme of the project.

### Artwork Creation Prompt

The following prompt was used as the foundation of the *PhishNet Art*:

```
Create a retro computer software style logo for 'PhishNet', featuring a fish figure. The design should be reminiscent of classic Windows 98 graphics, with a vintage, pixelated look. The logo should be playful yet relevant to the concept of phishing in cybersecurity, incorporating the fish figure creatively to symbolize the 'phish' in PhishNet. The overall style should evoke a sense of 1990s tech nostalgia.
```

## Usage

The images in this folder are used across various parts of the PhishNet project, including:
