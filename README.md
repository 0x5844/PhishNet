## TL;DR

**PhishNet** is a research project utilizing **Reinforced Self-Training (ReST)** and fine-tuned set of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create a high-quality synthetic dataset of phishing emails. Trained on various valuable email datasets (see [citations](#citations)), this project aims to dive into the exploration of adversarial AI and expand our understanding of AI safety.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Various datasets such as Enron Email Dataset, Spam Mails Database, etc.
- **Model Training**: Using various LLMs with Reinforced Self-Training.
- **Data Generation**: Synthesizing phishing emails for research.

## Local Installation & Usage

If you prefer to run PhishNet locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the model with your input data.

## Results and Evaluation

This section is under development and will be updated soon.
