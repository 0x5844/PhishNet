## TL;DR
**PhishNet** is a research project utilizing **Reinforced Self-Training (ReST)** and transformers to create a high-quality synthetic dataset of phishing emails. Trained on various valuable email datasets (see citations), this project aims to dive into the exploration of adversarial AI and expand our understanding of AI safety.
